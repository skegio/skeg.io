#### Well

## Docker rocks

#### and

## Docker Compose rocks

#### but...

I found that more often than not, I wanted to put my development environment inside of Docker, not just my running code.  My editor has plugins that help me browse documentation and check my syntax, but none of that works without installing additional stuff, and Docker has made me quite averse to installing anything on my host system.

So, I started stringing together Docker commands to do what I wanted, and I grew frustrated at all the copy/paste, and thought: [There's gotta be a better way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwROPN3Fir8)

Skeg is the result.

It's a little bit of software that helps me *develop* my code inside of a Docker container.  Some example commands:

- `skeg run -t go myapp` - run a go 1.6 environment for the current directory
- `skeg list` - list all environments
- `skeg destroy myapp` - destroy an environment

If you're interested in how it does this, see the [nitty gritty details](#details).
