## Do I have to use one of the pre-configured images?

Not at all.  You can create your own image and use it by specifying the `-i` flag to `skeg create` or `skeg run`.  For now, your image needs to be based on [skegio/base](https://hub.docker.com/r/skegio/base/) (like [nate/aws](https://hub.docker.com/r/nate/aws/)), but that will change as skeg gets more sophisticated.

## Why does skeg run the container as a long running process?

Development environments live longer than a single process, and they often involve many processes.

It's easy to rebuild an environment with the `skeg rebuild` command, which will destroy and create the docker container with the same environment home directory.
