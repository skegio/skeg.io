## Here's what skeg does under the hood when an environment is created:

Command: `skeg create -t python -v 3.5 myapp`

1. Ensure that the `skegio/python:3.5` image is pulled.
2. Ensure that the skeg ssh key is present.  If not, one is generated.
3. Create a directory in `~/envs/myapp`
4. Populate the `~/envs/myapp/.ssh/authorized_keys` file with the skeg public ssh key
5. Build an image based on `skegio/python:3.5` which includes a user matching the host user.
6. Start a container running sshd that mounts `~/envs/myapp` in as the user's home directory and the current directory in as a subdirectory.

## Then, to connect:

Command: `skeg connect myapp`

1. Execute ssh into the container using the private skeg ssh key
