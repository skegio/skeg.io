## Do I have to use one of the pre-configured images?

Not at all.  You can create your own image and use it by specifying the `-i` flag to `skeg create` or `skeg run`.  For now, your image needs to be based on [skegio/base](https://hub.docker.com/r/skegio/base/) (like [nate/aws](https://hub.docker.com/r/nate/aws/)), but that will change as skeg gets more sophisticated.

## Why does skeg run the container as a long running process and connect over SSH rather than only for the lifetime of a process?

Development environments live longer than a single process, and they often involve many processes.  Juggling these processes within an SSH session is a well understood problem with great solutions (like tmux), so for familiarity skeg takes the same approach.

Also, there are many times where additional software needs to be installed and daemons run to try something out.  A long running container is perfect for these situations.  Skeg offers a `rebuild` command, which will destroy and create the docker container with the same environment home directory, making it easy to reset back to a known state.
